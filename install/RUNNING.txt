            ===================================================
            Running the vyhodb 0.9.0 database management system
            ===================================================

vyhodb 0.9.0 requires the Java Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 1.7.0_45 or later.

==================================
Running With JRE 1.7.0_45 or later
==================================

(1) Download and Install the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 1.7.0_45 or later.

(1.2) Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

      You may also use the full JDK rather than just the JRE. In this
      case set you have to configure your environment variables
      differently - see below.


(2) Download and Install the vyhodb

(2.1) Download vyhodb binary distribution from http://www.vyhodb.com/ and 
      unpack it into a convenient location so that the distribution resides in
      its own directory.


(3) Configuring

      vyhodb itself is a Java application and does not use environment variables,
      but the startup script and other command line utilities use them.
      Currently, there is only one environment variable, which needs to be
      configured: JRE_HOME

(3.1) JRE_HOME

      This environment variable specifies location of JRE that should be used 
      to start vyhodb. You need to set it by yourself in one of the following
      scripts:

      bin-sh\set-env.sh     (Linux)
      
      Example:

      JRE_HOME=/home/igor/jdk1.7.0_79/jre       (Linux)
      
(3.2) Further information about configuring and running vyhodb can be found in
      the documentation included here, as well as on the vyhodb web site:

      http://www.vyhodb.com/


(4) Start Up vyhodb

(4.1) vyhodb can be started by executing one of the following commands:

      vdb-start.sh          (Linux)


(5) Shut Down vyhodb

(5.1) vyhodb can be shut down by stopping JVM process (Ctrl^C) or executing 
      one of the commands:

      bin-sh\vdb-close-remote.sh -host=localhost -port4666      (Linux)
